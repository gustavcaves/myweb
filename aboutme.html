    I am passionate about computer technology, I like to investigate on my own anything and topic that interests me.I have created this blog to transmit knowledge, ideas and everything I use at the computer level. In addition to serving as a record in time and see where I am progressing.

    A little history
    My beginnings in computer science were in high school, there were several techniques, I enrolled in computer science because I liked it, so it was two years learning about how to repair computers, install simple lan networks and configure programs on the computer.Then I did a professional training in System and Network Administration, where I delved deeper into this computer world, databases, wifi network analysis tools, structured cabling, among other things.I am currently studying Web Development with Platzi.As for the Blog, I publish opinion items and tools that I use on a day-to-day basis, on how to use them and productivity.
